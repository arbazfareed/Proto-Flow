# ProtoFlow

ProtoFlow is a local-first desktop prototyping tool built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tauri 2.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+
- Rust stable with the platform prerequisites listed in the [Tauri v2 setup guide](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

The Vite dev server listens on port `1420`. Frontend hot reload is enabled while Tauri ignores `src-tauri/`.

## Checks

```sh
npm run build
npm test
```

## Desktop bundles

`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` targets Windows MSI and Linux DEB/AppImage packages. The `.pflow` file association is declared as `application/x-protoflow+json`.

## Phase 1 status

The desktop shell, local project schema, file dialog flow, recovery checkpoint, keyboard shortcuts, and command palette are being built in this phase. The canvas renderer is intentionally reserved for Phase 2. Automatic updates are not active until a signed release feed and public key are configured.
